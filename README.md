# Python_Training

## Background
I have wanted to learn and use Python for ages. After many attempts and understanding that there are a lot of other tools to use to make use of python, I am finally here.

## Set Up
All the exercises are from the Udemy course. I plan to finally add my own files that can use used to create functions and create something that ties up many other aspects.
